# Twitter_offensive_dataset_classification
Here, I have classified the offensive tweets from the famous olid twitter dataset using the following top machine learning (ML) algorithms: 
1. Logistic Regression
2. Ridge Regression
3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
4. K Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)
5. Decision Tree
6. Random Forest

Upon the evaluation, among all the ML models, it was found that SVM and Logistic Regression classify the tweet datasets with higher accuracies of 81% and 80%, respectively.
