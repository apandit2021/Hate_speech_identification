# Twitter_offensive_language_identification_dataset
Hate speech has been a persistent problem on social media; it is used to disparage a person, or a group based on their organizational affiliation or personal attributes. Although various rules and regulations are implemented to diminish hate speech on social media, it is still prevalent in social medias like Facebook and Twitter. Early detection of hate speech can help deescalate the crime and conflicts in the society.

Here, I have classified the tweets in the famous olid twitter dataset (https://sites.google.com/site/offensevalsharedtask/olid) whether they are offensive or not by using top machine learning (ML) algorithms. I used some of the ML models here for my course project as well.
1. Logistic Regression
2. Ridge Regression
3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
4. K Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)
5. Decision Tree
6. Random Forest

About the data:\
We are provided with the training and test datasets as below:
Training: "olid-training-v1.0.tsv" is the original dataset which contains the tweets and their labels for each subtask. We will be using subtask_a and other columns are discarded here.
Testing: "testset-levela.tsv" is the test set we will be using for testing our model. This dataset contains the tweets to test the model trained on subtask_a. This dataset doesnâ€™t contain the labels for the tweets and is provided in a different file names "labels-levela.csv".


Upon the evaluation, among all the ML models, it was found that SVM and Logistic Regression classify the tweet datasets with higher accuracies of 81% and 80%, respectively.
