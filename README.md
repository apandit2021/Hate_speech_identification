# Twitter_offensive_dataset_classification
Here, I have classified the offensive tweets from the famous olid twitter dataset (https://sites.google.com/site/offensevalsharedtask/olid) using the following top machine learning (ML) algorithms. I used some of the ML models here for my course project as well.
1. Logistic Regression
2. Ridge Regression
3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
4. K Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)
5. Decision Tree
6. Random Forest

Upon the evaluation, among all the ML models, it was found that SVM and Logistic Regression classify the tweet datasets with higher accuracies of 81% and 80%, respectively.
